                  A demon who has lived on Earth since the dawn of creation.
                  Originally called "Crawley", he is the Serpent who tempted Eve
                  with the apple from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

                <h6>Aziraphale</h6>
                <p>
                  An angel who has lived on Earth since the dawn of creation. He
                  guarded the East gate entrance to the Garden of Eden with a
                  flaming sword, which he gave to Adam and Eve on their
                  expulsion from the Garden out of concern for their well-being.
                  He has grown to love the finer things of human life, enjoys
                  haute cuisine and owns an antiquarian bookshop in London.

                  Crowley’s connection with his Bentley is quite literally
                  magic, and he often uses his infernal power to control the
                  car. He can turn off the lights with a snap, repair dents and
                  dings, and drive through fire with sheer force of will alone.

                  Good Omens’ opener employs illustration, physical props,
                  character animation, 3D and even live-action footage to
                  foretell the show’s story about the clash of Heaven and Hell
                  and the coming apocalypse.
